# crypte-de-sedlec-scores

App to ease the count of points in the game `Crypt of Sedlec`

This project uses [`just`](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_1.html) because I wanted
an excuse to play with it.

To pin `requirements.txt` from `requirements.in` (uses `pip-tools` under the hood), run

```console
just compile-requirements
```

To install the requirements, including the `dev` ones, run

```console
just install-all
```

To install the requirements, including the `dev` ones, run

```console
just install
```
